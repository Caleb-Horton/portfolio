<h3> My Portfolio </h3>
<p> Welcome to my portfolio. Here, you will find examples of my work across a variety of mediums and professional contexts. </p>
<p> I work in political consulting, public policy, education, journalism, research, data, and photography. Soon, you will be able to find links to different pages that show examples of all these different kinds of work. </p>
<h2>Photography</h2>
<p> First and foremost, you can find my photography at <a href="https://flic.kr/ps/3PZZZE">Flicker.com</a>. I update this infrequently, but it is where I host the works I find most interesting and worthy of public view. Soon, you will be able to see selected shots on this website! </p>
